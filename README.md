# PolitelySecureDevice

The goal is to develop a device greeting people around based on face recognition. A later version will include the capability to alert the owner/tenant when there is intrusion. <br>
The development is conducted using a Model-Based System Engineering approach on the software [Capella](https://www.eclipse.org/capella/) to support the elicitation of the system needs and the design of an appropriate architecture.
